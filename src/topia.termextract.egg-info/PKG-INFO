Description: This package determines important terms within a given piece of content. It
        uses linguistic tools such as Parts-Of-Speech (POS) and some simple
        statistical analysis to determine the terms and their strength.

        CONTRIBUTIONS:
            * Unicode alphabetic characters are tokenized correctly.
            I changed TERM_SPEC in topic.termextract.tag:
                Old = [u'S', u'\xe3o', u'Paulo', u'was', u'home', u'to']
                New = [u'S\xe3o', u'Paulo', u'was', u'home', u'to']
            * extractor.extract() now has a parameter KEEP_ORIGINAL_SPACING=True,
            which allows you to keep the original spacing of the term:
                Old = [u'Mr . Smith']
                New = [u'Mr. Smith']
            * Fixed a bug where a term wouldn't be found if it was literally
            the last token of the sentence.
            * Fixed a bug (?) where unigram terms were included even if their
            tokens were part of a multiterm.

        Term Extraction
        ===============
        
        This package implements text term extraction by making use of a simple
        Parts-Of-Speech (POS) tagging algorithm.
        
        http://bioie.ldc.upenn.edu/wiki/index.php/Part-of-Speech
        
        
        The POS Tagger
        --------------
        
        POS Taggers use a lexicon to mark words with a tag. A list of available tags
        can be found at:
        
        http://bioie.ldc.upenn.edu/wiki/index.php/POS_tags
        
        Since words can have multiple tags, the determination of the correct tag is
        not always simple. This implementation, however, does not try to infer
        linguistic use and simply chooses the first tag in the lexicon.
        
          >>> from topia.termextract import tag
          >>> tagger = tag.Tagger()
          >>> tagger
          <Tagger for english>
        
        To get the tagger ready for its work, we need to initialize it. In this
        implementation the lexicon is loaded.
        
          >>> tagger.initialize()
        
        Now we are ready to rock and roll.
        
        Tokenizing
        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        The first step of tagging is to tokenize the text into terms.
        
          >>> tagger.tokenize('This is a simple example.')
          ['This', 'is', 'a', 'simple', 'example', '.']
        
        While most tokenizers ignore punctuation, it is important for us to keep it,
        since we need it later for the term extraction. Let's now look at some more
        complex cases:
        
        - Quoted Text
        
          >>> tagger.tokenize('This is a "simple" example.')
          ['This', 'is', 'a', '"', 'simple', '"', 'example', '.']
        
          >>> tagger.tokenize('"This is a simple example."')
          ['"', 'This', 'is', 'a', 'simple', 'example', '."']
        
        - Non-letters within words.
        
          >>> tagger.tokenize('Parts-Of-Speech')
          ['Parts-Of-Speech']
        
          >>> tagger.tokenize('amazon.com')
          ['amazon.com']
        
          >>> tagger.tokenize('Go to amazon.com.')
          ['Go', 'to', 'amazon.com', '.']
        
        - Various punctuation.
        
          >>> tagger.tokenize('Quick, go to amazon.com.')
          ['Quick', ',', 'go', 'to', 'amazon.com', '.']
        
          >>> tagger.tokenize('Live free; or die?')
          ['Live', 'free', ';', 'or', 'die', '?']
        
        - Tolerance to incorrect punctuation.
        
          >>> tagger.tokenize('Hi , I am here.')
          ['Hi', ',', 'I', 'am', 'here', '.']
        
        - Possessive structures.
        
          >>> tagger.tokenize("my parents' car")
          ['my', 'parents', "'", 'car']
          >>> tagger.tokenize("my father's car")
          ['my', 'father', "'s", 'car']
        
        - Numbers.
        
          >>> tagger.tokenize("12.4")
          ['12.4']
          >>> tagger.tokenize("-12.4")
          ['-12.4']
          >>> tagger.tokenize("$12.40")
          ['$12.40']
        
        - Dates.
        
          >>> tagger.tokenize("10/3/2009")
          ['10/3/2009']
          >>> tagger.tokenize("3.10.2009")
          ['3.10.2009']
        
        Okay, that's it.
        
        
        Tagging
        -------
        
        The next step is tagging. Tagging is done in two phases. During the first
        phase terms are assigned a tag by looking at the lexicon and the normalized
        form is set to the term itself. In the second phase, a set of rules is applied
        to each tagged term and the tagging and normalization is tweaked.
        
          >>> tagger('This is a simple example.')
          [['This', 'DT', 'This'],
           ['is', 'VBZ', 'is'],
           ['a', 'DT', 'a'],
           ['simple', 'JJ', 'simple'],
           ['example', 'NN', 'example'],
           ['.', '.', '.']]
        
        So wow, this determination was dead on. Let's try a plural form noun and see
        what happens:
        
          >>> tagger('These are simple examples.')
          [['These', 'DT', 'These'],
           ['are', 'VBP', 'are'],
           ['simple', 'JJ', 'simple'],
           ['examples', 'NNS', 'example'],
           ['.', '.', '.']]
        
        So far so good. Let's test a few more cases:
        
          >>> tagger("The fox's tail is red.")
          [['The', 'DT', 'The'],
           ['fox', 'NN', 'fox'],
           ["'s", 'POS', "'s"],
           ['tail', 'NN', 'tail'],
           ['is', 'VBZ', 'is'],
           ['red', 'JJ', 'red'],
           ['.', '.', '.']]
        
          >>> tagger("The fox can't really jump over the fox's tail.")
          [['The', 'DT', 'The'],
           ['fox', 'NN', 'fox'],
           ['can', 'MD', 'can'],
           ["'t", 'RB', "'t"],
           ['really', 'RB', 'really'],
           ['jump', 'VB', 'jump'],
           ['over', 'IN', 'over'],
           ['the', 'DT', 'the'],
           ['fox', 'NN', 'fox'],
           ["'s", 'POS', "'s"],
           ['tail', 'NN', 'tail'],
           ['.', '.', '.']]
        
        Rules
        ~~~~~
        
        - Correct Default Noun Tag
        
            >>> tagger('Ikea')
            [['Ikea', 'NN', 'Ikea']]
            >>> tagger('Ikeas')
            [['Ikeas', 'NNS', 'Ikea']]
        
        - Verify proper nouns at beginning of sentence.
        
            >>> tagger('. Police')
            [['.', '.', '.'], ['police', 'NN', 'police']]
            >>> tagger('Police')
            [['police', 'NN', 'police']]
            >>> tagger('. Stephan')
            [['.', '.', '.'], ['Stephan', 'NNP', 'Stephan']]
        
        - Determine Verb after Modal Verb
        
            >>> tagger('The fox can jump')
            [['The', 'DT', 'The'],
             ['fox', 'NN', 'fox'],
             ['can', 'MD', 'can'],
             ['jump', 'VB', 'jump']]
            >>> tagger("The fox can't jump")
            [['The', 'DT', 'The'],
             ['fox', 'NN', 'fox'],
             ['can', 'MD', 'can'],
             ["'t", 'RB', "'t"],
             ['jump', 'VB', 'jump']]
            >>> tagger('The fox can really jump')
            [['The', 'DT', 'The'],
             ['fox', 'NN', 'fox'],
             ['can', 'MD', 'can'],
             ['really', 'RB', 'really'],
             ['jump', 'VB', 'jump']]
        
        - Normalize Plural Forms
        
            >>> tagger('examples')
            [['examples', 'NNS', 'example']]
            >>> tagger('stresses')
            [['stresses', 'NNS', 'stress']]
            >>> tagger('cherries')
            [['cherries', 'NNS', 'cherry']]
        
          Some cases that do not work:
        
            >>> tagger('men')
            [['men', 'NNS', 'men']]
            >>> tagger('feet')
            [['feet', 'NNS', 'feet']]
        
        
        Term Extraction
        ---------------
        
        Now that we can tag a text, let's have a look at the term extractions.
        
          >>> from topia.termextract import extract
          >>> extractor = extract.TermExtractor()
          >>> extractor
          <TermExtractor using <Tagger for english>>
        
        As you can see, the extractor maintains a tagger:
        
          >>> extractor.tagger
          <Tagger for english>
        
        When creating an extractor, you can also pass in a tagger to avoid frequent
        tagger initialization:
        
          >>> extractor = extract.TermExtractor(tagger)
          >>> extractor.tagger is tagger
          True
        
        Let's get the terms for a simple text.
        
          >>> extractor("The fox can't jump over the fox's tail.")
          []
        
        We got no terms. That's because by default at least 3 occurences of a
        term must be detected, if the term consists of a single word.
        
        The extractor maintains a filter component. Let's register the trivial
        permissive filter, which simply return everything that the extractor suggests:
        
          >>> extractor.filter = extract.permissiveFilter
          >>> extractor("The fox can't jump over the fox's tail.")
          [('tail', 1, 1), ('fox', 2, 1)]
        
        But let's look at the default filter again, since it allows tweaking its
        parameters:
        
          >>> extractor.filter = extract.DefaultFilter(singleStrengthMinOccur=2)
          >>> extractor("The fox can't jump over the fox's tail.")
          [('fox', 2, 1)]
        
        Let's now have a look at multi-word terms. Oftentimes multi-word nouns and
        proper names occur only once or twice in a text. But they are often great
        terms! To handle this scenario, the concept of "strength" was
        introduced. Currently the strength is simply the amount of words in the
        term. By default, all terms with a strength larger than 1 are selected
        regardless of the number of occurances.
        
          >>> extractor('The German consul of Boston resides in Newton.')
          [('German consul', 1, 2)]

        This document provides a simple example of extracting the terms of a BBC

        As you can see, the identification of TreeTagger is pretty good, but the
        output would need some analysis to produce a useful set of terms. Furthermore,
        TreeTagger is not free for commercial use.
        
        Topia's Term Extractor
        ----------------------
        
        Topia's Term Extractor tries to produce results somewhere between a POS
        tagger like TreeTagger and Yahoo Keyword Extraction.
        
        Since we are only interested in nouns, a very simple POS tagging algorithm can
        be deployed, which will provide good results most of the time. We then use
        some simple statistics and linguistics to produce a narrow but strong list of
        terms for the content.
        
          >>> from topia.termextract import extract
          >>> extractor = extract.TermExtractor()
        
        Let's look at the result of the tagger first:
